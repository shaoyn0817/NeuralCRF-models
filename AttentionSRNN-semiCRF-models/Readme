Attention-SRNN-semiCRF models


1. Introduction
    This model combines an Attention based SRNN model with a semi-CRF model. The complete algorithm is implemented by statnlp framework(https://gitlab.com/sutd_nlp/statnlp-core). 
The algorithm mainly has two parts.
1) The first part is semi-CRF part. This part is implemented by Java. It is contained in src/main/java/semi_crf folder. Other files in src folder is the statnlp framework source code. 
2) The second part is Attention SRNN neural network part. This part is implemented in Torch. It is contained in nn-crf-interface/neural_server/AttentionSRNN.lua. 


2. Attention-SRNN Neural Network
    There is a toy example of Attention-SRNN neural network in sampleNetwork/sample_SRNN-Attention_Network.lua. 
To test this sample network, just enter the sampleNetwork folder, and run code
th sample_SRNN-Attention_Network.lua

Note: I have changed the Index.lua file in nn package. So, you need also download the sampleNetwork/Index.lua, and replace the old one in ~/torch/install/share/lua/5.2/nn/. Another option is to put the new Index.lua file in the same folder with sample_SRNN-Attention_Network.lua, and write a line of code "require 'Index'" in the top of sample_SRNN-Attention_Network.lua.
